# Cool Scripts

**Silly scripts in Python and Bash to make life easier**

### Steps to build :

  * Install `python3` and `pip3` 
  * Now, install the modules : `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

  * To run a Python script, type the following in the terminal : `python3 the_file_name.py`

  * An alternative way is :   
      * Add the shebang line at the starting of the file : `#! /usr/bin/python3`

      * Change file permissions to make it executable : `chmod +x the_file_name.py`

      * Run the script : `./name_of_script`

Some programs may need to use Google Chrome web browser and ChromeDriver, so it needs to be installed.
